# Pokedex Viewer App (Vanilla.js + jQuery)

## Introduction
A web-based Pokédex search and viewing tool built on the [Poké APIv2](https://pokeapi.co/) using Vanilla.js and jQuery. This tool allows the user to select from 14 different Pokédex versions, and to then dynamically generate a list of that Pokédex's Pokémon to help users learn more. Users can search through the Pokédex by Pokémon name or order number, and learn more about an individual Pokémon's details and moves.
